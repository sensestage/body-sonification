/// other sensors we brought:

// bend or stretch sensor, when worn around the knee, you can measure the bending of the knee

// -- explore the sensor data and see how it behaves, then use similar methods as for acceleration.



// muscle sensor, measures the electrical activity around a muscle
// -- explore the sensor data and see how it behaves, then use similar methods as for acceleration.
